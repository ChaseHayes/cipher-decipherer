cipher-decipherer  
## Goals
* Store a list of ciphers
  * Store some details about:
  * What they were used for
  * Where did they come from
  * How they work (formula?)
  * Implement each cipher programmatically
  * Allow users to:
    * Supply a value to be encoded
    * Specify a cipher to be used
    * View the encoded value generated from the given value and the cipher
    * Access some of the information stored about each ciper
